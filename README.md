# AWS ELB logs convertor

Log files generated by AWS Application Load Balancer contains lots of information.
Generaly we don't need all the information in these logs.

These scripts convert AWS Load Balancer logs into CSV file as well as Apache Web server log format.

## How to use

 - Create a directory with name ```alb-logs``` . If this directory is not present, script will create it on first run.

  - Place all the load balancer log files into ```alb-logs``` directory. 

  - To convert load balancer log files into CSV files run,

      ```
        python alb-to-csv.py
      ```

  - To convert load balancer log files into apache log fles run,
      ```
        python alb-to-apache.py
      ```
  - Converted file will be saved in ```csv``` or ```apache-logs``` directory depending upon which script you run.


## Notes

Both the scripts are configured according to my requirements. Feel free to make changes to scripts according to your needs.
